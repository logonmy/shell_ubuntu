I had the same problem, I solved it by commenting the lines where the unmanaged device was mentioned, by mac address, in /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf.

[main]
plugins=ifupdown,keyfile
dns=dnsmasq

[ifupdown]
managed=false

[keyfile]
unmanaged-devices=mac:00:26:2d:fd:5c:e0
changed to

[main]
plugins=ifupdown,keyfile
dns=dnsmasq

[ifupdown]
managed=false

\#[keyfile]

\#unmanaged-devices=mac:00:26:2d:fd:5c:e0
